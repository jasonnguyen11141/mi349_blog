        <h2>My name is Jason Nguyen</h2>
        <p>I am a student at Michigan State University studying Information Science. I'm hoping to go into the field of UX Design. I am currently a Junior so I have a couple more years left until I get my degree. </p>
        <p>On April 20th, 2003 I was born in Lansing. Grew up with my family in a large household consisting of my Parents, Grandparents, Brother, Sister, and then me. I was in the Lansing School Disctrict until my family decided to move to East Lansing for my siblings and I to have a better education, so in my 4th grade year I moved over to the East Lansing School District and graduated from there. Through out time I was in the East Lansing School District I was in band from Elementary School to the end of High School. I played the Trumpet for the 8 years I was in band and I was in the drumline for my High School Marching Band which was a fun experience for me. I don't really play anymore but I wish I kept playing for the fun of it. </p>
        <p>My favorite things to do is to play games in my free time as well as listening to music. I love playing the Call of Duty: Zombies Series from Treyarch Studios. I also play Pokemon Go a lot in my free time as well as during some downtime at work or whenever I'm outside walking from class while I listen to all the music I listen to.
