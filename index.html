            <p>The day before that day I was at a friends apartment and I went home fairly late. It was about 1:30AM is when I went to bed. Because I went to bed that late I woke up at got out of bed late. It was around 11 AM was when I woke up and I just doomscrolled on Instagram Reels for hours until 1 PM to get out of bed and hit the showers. Once I got ready for the day my grandma had made Mi Quang for the family to eat which is a traditional dish of central Vietnam. While I ate I was watching some YouTube because of course I can't eat without watching something. I also watched some lectures for school and took some notes as I fear I'm a tad behind in my Finance Class. After that I went to a friends apartment to watch some lectures but then we got bored and decided to watch The Boondocks which is this adult animated show about a black family moving to a predominatly white area. The boondocks is one of my favorite shows and <a title="watch" href="https://www.max.com/shows/boondocks/c43c65e7-49fe-4795-9e13-759bad094a78?utm_source=universal_search"> The Boondocks can be found of Max.</a> It is really funny and I highly recommend you watch it.</p>
